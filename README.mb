                   0. animation speed different (i amde a bit slower to show that it works as iphone effects)
                  
                   1. put in 1 file js+css because it example - more readable
                  
                   2. use jquery instead CSS3 to animation to make it work also for IE
                 
                   3. use jQuery instead pure Javascript - just take me less time to program
                
                   4. apple website like search effects - not all UI details but it close
               
                   5. make mini grid with display:inline-block as YUI
              
                   6. check only for CHROMIUN UBUNTU version 48
